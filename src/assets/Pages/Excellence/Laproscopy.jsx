                Laparoscopy is a procedure used to check the organs in the belly
                (abdomen). It can also check a woman's pelvic organs.
                Laparoscopy uses a thin lighted tube that has a video camera.
                The tube is called a laparoscope.

                One benefit of laparoscopy is that it is minimally invasive.
                That means it uses a very small cut in the belly. Laparoscopy
                usually takes less time and has a faster recovery than open
                surgery.

                Laparoscopy may be used to take a small tissue sample for
                testing (a biopsy). It can also be used to remove organs such as
                the appendix (appendectomy) or the gallbladder
                (cholecystectomy).

              <h5 className="text-secondary pt-4">
                A laparoscopy may be performed to find the cause of symptoms
                such as pelvic pain or subfertility â€“ this is known as a
                diagnostic laparoscopy. It helps your gynaecologist make a
                diagnosis.
